# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has our team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle and AWD are  rovided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset

-The slope of the linear model is not zero, becouse p-value is less than 0.05.

- The linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes in 71% which is accurate.
